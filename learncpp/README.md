# Notes

## What is C++ good at?

* Video games
* Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc...)
* High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequencyt trading)
* Graphical applications and simulations
* Productivity / office applications
* Embedded Software
* Audio and video processing
* Artificial intelligence and neural networks

## Determining how to solve the problem

Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:

* They are straightforward.
* They are well documentated.
* They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
* They are robust, and can recover or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.
